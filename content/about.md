Really, another blog?! Well more of a place for me to keep notes. It's basically to answer the question "So how did I set up that thing last year?" or "What was the command again, it's now fallen out of my zsh history". Luckily I wrote it down here!

There's going to be little to no editing, so watch out for paper cuts.

Got questions, feel free to [email me](mailto:ramblings@henryjenkins.name) or DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/steakunderscore).
